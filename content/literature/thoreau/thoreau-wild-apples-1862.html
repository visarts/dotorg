<p>It is remarkable how closely the history of the apple-tree is connected with that of man. The geologist tells us that the order of the <em>Rosaceœ,</em> which includes the Apple, also the true Grasses, and the <em>Labiatœ,</em> or Mints, were introduced only a short time previous to the appearance of man on the globe.</p>
<p>It appears that apples made a part of the food of that unknown primitive people whose traces have lately been found at the bottom of the Swiss lakes, supposed to be older than the foundation of Rome, so old that they had no metallic implements. An entire black and shriveled Crab-Apple has been recovered from their stores.</p>
<p>Tacitus says of the ancient Germans, that they satisfied their hunger with wild apples (<em>agrestia poma</em>) among other things.</p>
<p>Niebuhr observes that &ldquo;the words for a house, a field, a plough, ploughing, wine, oil, milk, sheep, apples, and others relating to agriculture and the gentler way of life, agree in Latin and Greek, while the Latin words for all objects pertaining to war or the chase are utterly alien from the Greek, while the Latin words for all objects pertaining to war or the cause are utterly alien from the Greek.&rdquo; Thus the apple-tree may be considered a symbol of peace no less than the olive.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The apple was early so important, and generally distributed, that its name traced to its root in many languages signifies fruit in general. <em>Mhlon,</em> in Greek, means an apple, also the fruit of other trees, also a sheep and any cattle, and finally riches in general.</p>
<p>The apple-tree has been celebrated by the Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and Scandinavians. Some have thought that the first human pair were tempted by its fruit. Goddesses are fabled to have contended for it, dragons were set to watch it, and heroes were employed to pluck it.</p>
<p>The tree is mentioned in at least three places in the Old Testament, and its fruit in two or three more. Solomon sings,—&ldquo;As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.&rdquo; And again,—&ldquo;Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples.&rdquo; The noblest part of man's noblest feature is named from this fruit, &ldquo;the apple of the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apple-tree is also mentioned by Homer and Herodotus. Ulysses saw in the glorious garden of Alcinous &ldquo;pears and pomegranates, and apple-trees bearing beautiful fruit&rdquo; (<em>kai mhleai aglaokarpoi</em>). And according to Homer, apples were among the fruits which Tantalus could not pluck, the wind ever blowing their boughs away from him. Theophrastus knew and described the apple-tree as a botanist.</p>
<p>According to the Prose Edda, &ldquo;Iduna keeps in a box the apples which the gods, when they feel old age approaching, have only to taste of to become young again. It is in this manner that they will be kept in renovated youth until Ragnarök&rdquo; (or the destruction of the gods).</p>
<div data-pos="boxright"></div>
<p>I learn from Loudon that &ldquo;the ancient Welsh bards were rewarded for excelling in song, by the token of the applespray&rdquo;; and &ldquo;in the Highlands of Scotland the apple-tree is the badge of the clan Lamont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apple-tree, (<em>Pyrus malus</em>) belongs chiefly to the northern temperate zone. London says, that &ldquo;it grows spontaneously in every part of Europe, except the frigid zone, and throughout Western Asia, China, and Japan.&rdquo; We have also two or three varieties of the apple indigenous in North America. The cultivated apple-tree was first introduced into this country by the earliest settlers, and it is thought to do as well or better here than anywhere else. Probably some of the varieties which are now cultivated were first introduced into Britain by the Romans.</p>
<p>Pliny, adopting the distinction of Theophrastus, says,—&ldquo;Of trees there are some which are altogether wild (<em>sylvestres</em>), song more, civilized (<em>urbaniores</em>).&rdquo; Theophrastus includes the apple among the last; and, indeed, it is in this sense the most civilized of all trees. It is as harmless as a dove, as beautiful as a rose, and as valuable as flocks and herds. It has been longer cultivated than any other, and so is more humanized; and who knows but, like the dog, it will at length be no longer traceable to its wild original? It migrates with man, like the dog and horse and cow: first, perchance from Greece to Italy, thence to England: thence to America; and our Western emigrant is still marching steadily toward the setting sun with the seeds of the apple in his pocket, or perhaps a few young trees strapped to his load. At least a million apple-trees are thus set farther westward this year than any cultivated ones grew last year. Consider how the Blossom-Week, like the Sabbath, is thus annually spreading over the prairies; for when man migrates, he carries with him not only his birds, quadrupeds, insects, vegetables, and his very sword, but his orchard also.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The leaves and tender twigs are an agreeable food to many domestic animals, as the cow, horse, sheep, and goat; and the fruit is sought after by the first, as well as by the hog. Thus there appears to have existed a natural alliance between these animals and this tree from the first. &ldquo;The fruit of the Crab in the forests of France&rdquo; is said to be &ldquo;a great resource for the wild-boar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only the Indian, but many indigenous insects, birds, and quadrupeds, welcomed the apple-tree to these shores. The tent-caterpillar saddled her eggs on the very first twig that was formed, and it has since shared her affections with the wild cherry; and the canker-worm also in a measure abandoned the elm to feed on it. As it grew apace, the blue-bird, robin, cherry-bird, king-bird, and many more, came with haste and built their nests and warbled in its boughs, and so became orchard-birds, and multiplied more than ever. It was an era in the history of their race. The downy woodpecker found such a savory morsel under its bark, that he perforated it in a ring, quite round the tree, before he left it,—a thing which he had never done before, to my knowledge. It did not take the partridge long to find out how sweet its buds were, and every winter eve she flew, and still flies, from the wood, to pluck them, much to the farmer's sorrow. The rabbit, too, was not slow to learn the taste of its twigs and bark; and when the fruit was ripe, the squirrel half-rolled, half-carried it to his hole; and even the musquash crept up the bank from the brook at evening, and greedily devoured it, until he had worn a path in the grass there; and when it was frozen and thawed, the crow and the jay were glad to taste it occasionally. The owl crept into the first apple-tree that became hollow, and fairly hooted with delight, finding it just the place for him; so settling down into it, he has remained there ever since.</p>
<div data-pos="boxright"></div>
<p>My theme being the Wild Apple, I will merely glance at some of the seasons in the annual growth of the cultivated apple, and pass on to my special province.</p>
<p>The flowers of the apple are perhaps the most beautiful of any tree's, so copious and so delicious to both sight and scent. The walker is frequently tempted to turn and linger near some more than usually handsome one, whose blossoms are two-thirds expanded. How superior it is in these respects to the pear, whose blossoms are neither colored nor fragrant!</p>
<p>By the middle of July, green apples are so large as to remind us of coddling, and of the autumn. The sward is commonly strewed with little ones which fall still-born, as it were,—Nature thus thinning them for us. The Roman writer Palladius said,—&ldquo;If apples are inclined to fall before their time, a stone placed in a split root will retain them.&rdquo; Some such notion, still surviving, may account for some of the stones which we see placed to be overgrown in the forks of trees. They have a saying in Suffolk, England,—</p>
<blockquote>At Michaelmas time, or a little before,<br>
  Half an apple goes to the core.</blockquote>
<p>Early apples begin to be ripe about the first of August; but I think that none of them are so good to eat as some to smell. One is worth more to scent your hand-kerchief with than any perfume which they sell in the shops. The fragrance of some fruits is not to be forgotten, along with that of flowers. Some gnarly apple which I pick up in the road reminds me by its fragrance of all the wealth of Pomona,—carrying me forward to those days when they will be collected in golden and ruddy heaps in the orchards and about the cider-mills.</p>
<div></div>
<p>A week or two later, as you are going, by orchards or gardens, especially in the evenings, you pass through a little region possessed by the fragrance of ripe apples, and thus enjoy them without price, and without robbing anybody.</p>
<p>There is thus about all natural products a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value, and which cannot be vulgarized, or bought and sold. No mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect flavor of any fruit, and only the god-like among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities. For nectar and ambrosia are only those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceive,—just as we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing, it. When I see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair and fragrant early apples to market, I seem to see a contest going on between him and his horse, on the one side, and the apples on the other, and, to my mind, the apples always gain it. Pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things, and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of a load of them. Our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not belong, that is, to any but the most beautiful. Though he gets out from time to time, and feels of them, and thinks they are all there, I see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart, while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market. They are not apples, but pomace. Are not these still Iduna's apples, the taste of which keeps the gods forever young? and think you that they will let Loki or Thjassi carry them off to Jötunheim, while they grow wrinkled and gray? No, for Ragnarök, or the destruction of the gods, is not yet.</p>
<div data-pos="boxright"></div>
<p>There is another thinning of the fruit, commonly near the end of August or in September, when the ground is strewn with windfalls; and this happens especially when high winds occur after rain. In some orchards you may see fully three quarters of the whole crop on the ground, lying in a circular form beneath the trees, yet hard and green,—or, if it is a hill-side, rolled far down the hill. However, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. All the country over, people are busy picking up the windfalls, and this will make them cheap for early apple-pies.</p>
<p>In October, the leaves falling, the apples are more distinct in the trees. I saw one year in a neighboring town some trees fuller of fruit than I remembered to have ever seen before, small yellow apples banging over the road. The branches were gracefully drooping with their weight, like a barberry-bush, so that the whole tree acquired a new character. Even the topmost branches, instead of standing erect, spread and drooped in all directions; and there were so many poles supporting the lower ones, that they looked like pictures of banian-trees. As an old English manuscript says, &ldquo;The mo appelen the tree bereth, the more sche boweth to the folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely the apple is the noblest of fruits. Let the most beautiful or the swiftest have it. That should be the &ldquo;going&rdquo; price of apples.</p>
<p>Between the fifth and twentieth of October I see the barrels lie under the trees. And perhaps I talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels to fulfil an order. He turns a specked one over many times before he leaves it out. If I were to tell what is passing in my mind, I should say that every one was specked which he had handled; for he rubs off all the bloom, and those fugacious ethereal qualifies leave it. Cool evenings prompt the farmers to make haste, and at length I see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees.</p>
<div></div>
<p>It would be well, if we accepted these gifts with more joy and gratitude, and did not think it enough simply to put a fresh load of compost about the tree. Some old English customs are suggestive at least. I find them described chiefly in Brand's &ldquo;Popular Antiquities.&rdquo; It appears that &ldquo;on Christmas eve the farmers and their men in Devonshire take a large bowl of cider, with a toast in it, and carrying it in state to the orchard, they salute the apple-trees with much ceremony, in order to make them bear well the next season.&rdquo; This salutation consists in &ldquo;throwing some of the cider about the roots of the tree, placing, bits of the toast on the branches,&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;encircling one, of the best bearing trees in the orchard, they drink the following toast three several times:—</p>
<blockquote>&lsquo;Here's to thee, old apple-tree,<br>
  Whence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst, blow,<br>
  And whence thou mayst bear apples enow!<br>
  Hats-full! caps-full!<br>
  Bushel, bushel, sacks-full!<br>
  And my pockets full, too! Hurra!&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Also what was called &ldquo;apple-howling&rdquo; used to be practised in various counties of England on New-Year's eve. A troop of boys visited the different orchards, and, encircling the apple-trees, repeated the following words:—</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Stand fast, root! bear well, top!<br>
  Pray God send us a good howling crop:<br>
  Every twig, apples big;<br>
  Every bough, apples enow!&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They then shout in chorus, one of the boys accompanying them on a cow's horn. During this ceremony they rap the trees with, their sticks.&rdquo; This is called &ldquo;wassailing&rdquo; the trees, and is thought by some to be a relic of the heathen sacrifice to Pomona.</p>
<div data-pos="boxright"></div>
<p>Herrick sings,—</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Wassaile the trees that they mail beare<br>
  You many a plum and many a peare;<br>
  For more or less fruits they will bring,<br>
  As you so give them wassailing.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Our poets have as yet a better right to sing of cider than of wine; but it behooves them to sing, better than English Phillips did, else they will do no credit to their Muse.</p>
