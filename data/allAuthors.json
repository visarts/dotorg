The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.","content":[{"title":"Because I Could Not Stop for Death","date":"1890","fileName":"dickinson-because-i-could-not-stop-for-death-1890","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[613]},{"title":"A Book","date":"1873","fileName":"dickinson-book-1873","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[228]},{"title":"The Bustle in a House","date":"1890","fileName":"dickinson-bustle-in-a-house-1890","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[205]},{"title":"Come slowly, Eden!","date":"1861","fileName":"dickinson-come-slowly-eden-1861","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[203]},{"title":"Death Sets A Thing","date":"1924","fileName":"dickinson-death-sets-a-thing-1924","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[578]},{"title":"Heart, we will forget him!","date":"1924","fileName":"dickinson-heart-we-will-forget-him-1924","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[235]},{"title":"Hope is the Thing with Feathers","date":"1891","fileName":"dickinson-hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-1891","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[366]},{"title":"I Felt a Funeral in My Brain","date":"1861","fileName":"dickinson-i-felt-a-funeral-in-my-brain-1861","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[498]},{"title":"I Went to Heaven","date":"1863","fileName":"dickinson-i-went-to-heaven-1863","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[298]},{"title":"My Life Closed Twice Before it Closed","date":"1896","fileName":"dickinson-my-life-closed-twice-before-it-closed-1896","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[239]},{"title":"The Mystery of Pain","date":"1896","fileName":"dickinson-mystery-of-pain-1896","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[231]},{"title":"A Narrow Fellow in the Grass","date":"1866","fileName":"dickinson-narrow-fellow-in-the-grass-1866","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[657]},{"title":"The Only News I Know","date":"1864","fileName":"dickinson-only-news-i-know-1864","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[273]},{"title":"Success is Counted Sweetest","date":"1864","fileName":"dickinson-success-is-counted-sweetest-1864","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[321]},{"title":"Summer Shower","date":"1890","fileName":"dickinson-summer-showers-1890","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[496]},{"title":"There is a Word","date":"1924","fileName":"dickinson-there-is-a-word-1924","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[388]},{"title":"This is my Letter to the World","date":"1890","fileName":"dickinson-this-is-my-letter-to-the-world-1890","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[232]},{"title":"A Thunderstorm","date":"1896","fileName":"dickinson-thunderstorm-1896","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[632]},{"title":"We Like March","date":"1924","fileName":"dickinson-we-like-march-1924","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[346]},{"title":"When Roses Cease to Bloom, Dear","date":"1924","fileName":"dickinson-when-roses-cease-to-bloom-dear-1924","genre":"poetry","pageSizes":[238]}]},"frost":{"fname":"Robert","lname":"Frost","bio":"His work was initially published in England before it was published in America.

1883 â€“ 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work, which fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. The term 'Kafkaesque' has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.","content":[{"title":"A Hunger
