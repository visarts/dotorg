was a German-language novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work, which fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. The term 'Kafkaesque' has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.","content":[{"title":"A Hunger

Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.
